## Current Challenges (Q1 2026)

1. **Data fragmentation** - WMS, TMS, and ERP don't talk to each other cleanly
2. **Manual rate shopping** - Takes 45+ minutes per complex shipment
3. **Inventory accuracy** - Running at 94.2%, target is 98%+
4. **SOP inconsistency** - 40+ SOPs, last audit found 30% outdated
5. **Carrier communication** - Still heavy on email/phone for exceptions

---

## AI Initiative Priorities

1. Automate rate shopping for standard lanes
2. Exception alerting and recommended actions
3. SOP digitization and workflow mapping
4. Demand forecasting integration
5. Carrier performance scoring
