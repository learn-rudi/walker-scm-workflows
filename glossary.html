                <p class="term-def">A shipment that doesn't fill a full truck. Multiple shippers share trailer space, and pricing is based on weight, dimensions, and freight class.</p>

                <p class="term-def">Shipping that uses multiple transportation modes (typically truck + rail) using standardized containers that transfer between modes.</p>
                <p class="term-example">Example: "For coast-to-coast, intermodal is 30% cheaper than FTL if you have 5+ days."</p>
