SUBJECT: FTL Quote Request - Dallas to Phoenix (weekly)

Hi Walker team,

We're looking for a carrier partner for a new weekly lane and wanted to get your rates.

Details:
- Origin: Dallas, TX 75201 (our DC - dock hours 6am-4pm)
- Destination: Phoenix, AZ 85001 (customer DC - appointment required)

- Weight: Approximately 38,000 lbs (full truck, palletized)

We need delivery within 3 days of pickup. No weekend delivery needed.

This would be an ongoing weekly shipment. Can you provide your best rate for a committed lane?

Also - do you have any capacity concerns for Texas outbound right now? We've been hearing things are tight.

Thanks,

FROM: Tom Bradley &lt;tbradley@eliteretail.com&gt;
SUBJECT: LTL rate needed - liftgate + residential

Hi,

I need a rate for a delivery to one of our franchise locations. It's a strip mall location with no dock, so we'll need liftgate service.

Shipment info:
- 6 pallets, 4,800 lbs total
- 48x40 pallets, about 48" high each
- Class 92.5
- Picking up from: Los Angeles, CA 90001
- Delivering to: Seattle, WA 98101

The delivery address is technically commercial (it's a retail store) but there's no dock and limited space. Driver will need to set pallets at the back door.

Customer is asking when they can expect delivery if we ship this Monday.

Let me know,

- Indianapolis (8 pallets): ~$320-380
- Louisville (10 pallets): ~$380-450
- Nashville (6 pallets): ~$350-420
- Atlanta (8 pallets): ~$480-560

SUBJECT: Multi-stop FTL quote - 4 drops

Hi,

Looking for a rate on a multi-stop full truckload.

Route:
- Pickup: Chicago, IL 60601 (our main DC)
- Stop 1: Indianapolis, IN 46201 - drop 8 pallets
- Stop 2: Louisville, KY 40201 - drop 10 pallets
- Stop 3: Nashville, TN 37201 - drop 6 pallets
- Stop 4: Atlanta, GA 30301 - drop 8 pallets (final)

Details:
- Total: 32 pallets, approximately 28,000 lbs
- Dry van
- All stops are commercial with docks
- Would ship Monday, need all deliveries completed by Thursday EOD

What's the rate? Also, is it cheaper to do this as one multi-stop or break it into separate LTL shipments? I'm open to whatever makes more sense cost-wise.

Going from somewhere in Texas to somewhere in Florida. I can get you the exact addresses if you need them.
