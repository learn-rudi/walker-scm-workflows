## SCENARIO D: Service Issue Apology (Our Fault)

### Situation
**Customer:** Premier Retail Group  
**Contact:** James Morrison, VP of Logistics  
**Email:** jmorrison@premierretail.com  
**Relationship:** 5-year customer, $120K/month, strategic account  

**What happened:**  
We shipped the wrong product to 4 of their retail stores last week. Instead of spring seasonal merchandise, we sent clearance items that were supposed to go to their outlet stores.

**Impact:**
- 4 stores received wrong product (about 200 units each)
- Stores had to refuse delivery and call customer service
- Premier had to expedite correct shipments at their cost ($1,800)
- Their stores missed a promotional window

**Root cause:**  
Our warehouse team mislabeled pallets during a high-volume day. This was our error.

**What we've done:**
- Shipped correct product via expedited freight (at our cost)
- Retrieved incorrect product from stores
- Implemented additional QC check for this customer

**Your task:**  
Draft an apology email to James. This is a major account and a significant error. We need to own it, explain what happened, and describe what we're doing to prevent recurrence. Consider whether we should offer a credit.

**Account health:**

- Volume has been flat (no growth)

**What we want:**
- Renew for another 2 years
- Ideally, grow the business (they have West Coast volume going elsewhere)

**Competitive concern:**
- We heard through industry contacts they took meetings with DHL Supply Chain
- Their West Coast business might be up for bid

**Your task:**  
Draft an email to Karen to start the renewal conversation. You want to gauge their satisfaction, understand their plans, and ideally schedule a meeting to discuss renewal and growth opportunities.
