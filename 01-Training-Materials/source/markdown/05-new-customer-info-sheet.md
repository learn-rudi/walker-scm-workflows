### Notes from Sales Calls

**1/10/25 - Initial call with Mike Torres:**
> "We've been with Midwest Distribution for 3 years but they dropped the ball last peak season. We had 15% of orders delayed and it cost us big accounts. We need a partner who can scale with us. We're growing fast - expect to double volume in 2 years."

**1/15/25 - Facility tour:**
> Toured our Chicago facility with Mike and Jennifer. They were impressed with the assembly area. Jennifer asked specifically about our contingency plans for peak season staffing. They want to see references from other furniture customers.

**1/18/25 - Follow-up call:**
> Mike confirmed they're down to us and XPO. Price is close. He said the decision will likely come down to references and confidence in peak season performance. Need to get them talking to Henderson Furniture (similar customer).
