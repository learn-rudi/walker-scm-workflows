## Rate Request #1 - Simple LTL

**From:** Mike Davidson <mdavidson@acmemfg.com>  
**To:** sales@walkerlogistics.com  
**Subject:** Quick rate check - Atlanta to Nashville

Hey,

Need a quick rate for a customer shipment.

2 pallets, about 1,400 lbs total. Class 85. Standard stuff - no special handling.

Going from our Atlanta plant (30301) to a customer in Nashville (37201).

Customer needs it there by Friday - so probably needs to ship tomorrow or Wednesday at the latest.

What can you do?

We're looking for a carrier partner for a new weekly lane and wanted to get your rates.

## Rate Request #3 - LTL with Special Requirements

**From:** Tom Bradley <tbradley@eliteretail.com>  
**To:** sales@walkerlogistics.com  
**Subject:** LTL rate needed - liftgate + residential

Hi,

I need a rate for a delivery to one of our franchise locations. It's a strip mall location with no dock, so we'll need liftgate service.

**Shipment info:**
- 6 pallets, 4,800 lbs total
- 48x40 pallets, about 48" high each
- Class 92.5
- Picking up from: Los Angeles, CA 90001
- Delivering to: Seattle, WA 98101

The delivery address is technically commercial (it's a retail store) but there's no dock and limited space. Driver will need to set pallets at the back door.

Customer is asking when they can expect delivery if we ship this Monday.

Let me know,

## Rate Request #5 - Multi-Stop / Complex

**From:** James Wright <jwright@nationwide.com>  
**To:** quotes@walkerlogistics.com  
**Subject:** Multi-stop FTL quote - 4 drops

Hi,

Looking for a rate on a multi-stop full truckload.

**Route:**
- Pickup: Chicago, IL 60601 (our main DC)
- Stop 1: Indianapolis, IN 46201 - drop 8 pallets
- Stop 2: Louisville, KY 40201 - drop 10 pallets
- Stop 3: Nashville, TN 37201 - drop 6 pallets
- Stop 4: Atlanta, GA 30301 - drop 8 pallets (final)

**Details:**
- Total: 32 pallets, approximately 28,000 lbs
- Dry van
- All stops are commercial with docks
- Would ship Monday, need all deliveries completed by Thursday EOD

What's the rate? Also, is it cheaper to do this as one multi-stop or break it into separate LTL shipments? I'm open to whatever makes more sense cost-wise.

Thanks,

## Rate Request #6 - Vague / Incomplete (Good for Practice)

**From:** Chris Taylor <ctaylor@smallbiz.com>  
**To:** info@walkerlogistics.com  
**Subject:** shipping quote

Hi,

I need to ship some stuff from our warehouse to a customer.

It's about 10 boxes, maybe 500 pounds total? Not really sure on the exact dims but they're not huge. Regular cardboard boxes.

Going from somewhere in Texas to somewhere in Florida. I can get you the exact addresses if you need them.

How much would that cost and how long does it take?

## Rate Request #7 - International / Cross-Border

**From:** Maria Santos <msantos@globalimports.com>

**Subject:** Cross-border rate - Mexico to Chicago

Hello,

We need a rate for cross-border freight from Mexico.

**Details:**
- Origin: Monterrey, Mexico (supplier's facility)
- Destination: Chicago, IL 60601 (our warehouse)
- Freight: 12 pallets, 16,000 lbs
- Commodity: Auto parts (HS code 8708.99)
- Value: $85,000 USD

**Questions:**
1. What's your door-to-door rate including customs clearance?
2. Do you handle the customs brokerage or do we need our own broker?
3. What's typical transit time?
4. What documents do we need to provide?

We do this shipment monthly and would consider a contract rate if the pricing is competitive.

Thanks,
